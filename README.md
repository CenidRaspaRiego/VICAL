VICAL is a open-source implementation to calculate 23 VIs map (VIs commonly used in agricultural applications) and time series of any agricultural area in the world with images (cloud-free) from Landsat and Sentinel-2 data. The VICAL tool was developed on the GEE platform (https://earthengine.google.com/) and it was encoded in JavaScript.

A web application is also available (https://inifapcenidraspa.users.earthengine.app/view/vical).

The VICAL help section in Spanish is available at: (https://serchjimenez09.github.io/VICAL_B/)

The VICAL tool has three main functions: (i) calculation of 23 VIs with images (cloud-free) from Landsat (4, 5, 7, 8 and 9) and Sentinel-2 data from any user-defined area; (ii) VI time series plot for each polygon drawn by the user with Landsat and Sentinel-2 or both satellites, and iii) Regression maps (linear, quadratic, potential or exponential function) using VIs values.
